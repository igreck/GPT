I need to solve the equation âˆš(xÂ² + 165) - âˆš(xÂ² - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\nâˆš(xÂ² + 165) - âˆš(xÂ² - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\nâˆš(xÂ² + 165) = 7 + âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(âˆš(xÂ² + 165))Â² = (7 + âˆš(xÂ² - 52))Â².\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nxÂ² + 165 = 49 + 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52) + (âˆš(xÂ² - 52))Â².\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)Â² = aÂ² + 2ab + bÂ². So the right side becomes 7Â² + 2*7*âˆš(xÂ² - 52) + (âˆš(xÂ² - 52))Â², which is 49 + 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52) + (xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nxÂ² + 165 = 49 + 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52) + xÂ² - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The xÂ² terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract xÂ² from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\n12 = âˆš(xÂ² - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12Â² = xÂ² - 52.\\n\\n144 = xÂ² - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = xÂ².\\n\\n196 = xÂ².\\n\\nSo x = âˆš196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\nâˆš(14Â² + 165) - âˆš(14Â² - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14Â² is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: âˆš(196 + 165) = âˆš361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: âˆš(196 - 52) = âˆš144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\nTo solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9. Add 52 to both sides to solve for \\\\(x^2\\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   196 = x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n10. Take the positive square root (since \\\\(x\\\\) is positive):\\n    \\\\[\\n    x = \\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n11. Verify the solution by substituting \\\\(x = 14\\\\) back into the original equation:\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\sqrt{14^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{14^2 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{196 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{196 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{361} - \\\\sqrt{144} = 19 - 12 = 7\\n    \\\\]\\n    The solution checks out.\\n\\nThus, the only positive solution is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{14}\\n\\\\]<end_working_out><SOLUTION>14</SOLUTION><|endoftext|>\""

Her younger brother mistook all her nickels for dimes and counted the total as $1.47. How many pennies does Jenifer have?<start_working_out>Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Jenifer who has 82 cents in pennies and nickels. But her younger brother thought all the nickels were dimes and counted the total as $1.47. We need to find out how many pennies Jenifer has. Hmm, let's break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to set up some variables. Let's say the number of pennies is P and the number of nickels is N. Since pennies are worth 1 cent each and nickels 5 cents, the total value Jenifer has is 1*P + 5*N = 82 cents. That's the first equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, her brother mistook the nickels for dimes. Dimes are 10 cents each, right? So he counted the nickels as dimes. So the total he thought she had would be P*1 + N*10 = 147 cents (since $1.47 is 147 cents). So that's the second equation: P + 10N = 147.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now we have two equations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) P + 5N = 82\n",
      "2) P + 10N = 147\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to solve these two equations to find P. Let me think. Maybe subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate P. Wait, no, that might not help. Alternatively, I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate P. Let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (P + 10N) - (P + 5N) = 147 - 82. That simplifies to 5N = 65. Then N = 13. So there are 13 nickels. Then plug that back into the first equation to find P. So P + 5*13 = 82. 5*13 is 65, so P = 82 - 65 = 17. So Jenifer has 17 pennies. Let me verify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she has 17 pennies and 13 nickels, that's 17 + 65 = 82 cents, which matches. Then her brother would count the nickels as dimes, so 17 + 130 = 147 cents, which is $1.47. That checks out. So the answer should be 17 pennies. I think that's right.\n",

      "1. Jenifer has a total of 82 cents in pennies and nickels.\n",
